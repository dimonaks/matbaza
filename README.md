# matbaza
Simple web interface for presenting and analyzing computational materials results.
The results are shown in the form of interactive table for each calculated material.
The table is generated by JS dataTables library from simple cvs file, which is created with special python
scripts in dbmaker folder. 
The detailed information about each calculation is stored in a python serialized .pickle file.
To read a .pickle file a python script should be executed from JS. See aksenov.js for small functions doing this. 

The main file is csvhtml/index.html
The python scripts require SIMAN library.




Current features:
1. Calculate average intercalation potential.
	How: choose two rows with different concentrations for the same material; press "Potential" button
2. Show crystal structure in the embedded JSmol applet
    How: choose one row and press button "Show in Jmol"
